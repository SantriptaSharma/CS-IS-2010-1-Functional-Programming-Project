### Iris Classification Inference
Develop a classification model over the Iris Dataset and store the model. Then write a Haskell code to
restore the model, input new data (based on the four features of the iris) and generate a prediction in real
time.
1. Input: The Iris Dataset
2. Output: Real-time prediction for the class of the flower of a new data row containing the sepal width, petal width, sepal length and petal length.
3. Method: You can use Python to train and save a classification model (SVM or NN). However, restoring the model and the real-time prediction of a new data row has to be written only in Haskell.
